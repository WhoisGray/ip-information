# üåê IP Information

A simple Node.js application that captures client request details and provides information about the client, including IP address, user agent, and geo location.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/WhoisGray/ip-information.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```shell
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## üöÄ Usage

### Pull the Docker Image

```shell
docker pull WhoisGray/ip-information:latest
```

### Run the Docker Container

```shell
docker run -p 3000:3000 WhoisGray/ip-information:latest
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

## üê≥ Docker Compose

If you prefer to use Docker Compose, you can use the following docker-compose.yml file:

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  ip-information:
    image: whoisgray/ip-information:latest
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```

Save this content in a file named docker-compose.yml in your project directory, and then run the following command:

```shell
  docker-compose up
```

This will start the IP Information application in a Docker container.

## üê≥ Docker

This project includes Docker and Docker Compose files, allowing you to easily containerize and run the application in a Docker environment. To use Docker, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker on your machine.
2. Build the Docker image:
   ```shell
   docker build -t ip-information .
   ```
3. Run the Docker container:
   ```shell
   docker run -p 3000:3000 ip-information
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìã Features

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [geoip-lite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geoip-lite) - Light-weight module to look up IP address information.

## Routes

The application defines the following routes:

- **Root Route ("/")**

  - This route handles GET requests to the root URL ("/").
  - It retrieves the client's public IP address and sends it as a response to the client.
  - The IP address is extracted from the request headers, specifically the "x-forwarded-for" header or the remote address.
  - The IP address is displayed as a response message, indicating the client's public IP address.

- **"/details" Route**
  - This route handles GET requests to the "/details" URL.
  - It retrieves additional information about the client, including IP address, user agent, and geo location.
  - The IP address is extracted from the request headers, similar to the root route.
  - The user agent information is obtained from the "user-agent" header in the request.
  - The geo location information is obtained using the "geoip-lite" package based on the client's IP address.
  - The response is a JSON object containing the client's IP address, user agent, and geo location details, along with other request information like URL, method, headers, and cookies.

You can access the root route ("/") to retrieve the client's public IP address and the "/details" route to obtain more comprehensive client information.

Feel free to modify or add more routes based on your application's requirements.
